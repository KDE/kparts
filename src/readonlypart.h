 * @class ReadOnlyPart readonlypart.h <KParts/ReadOnlyPart>
 *
 * @short Base class for any "viewer" part.
 *
 * This class takes care of network transparency for you,
 * in the simplest way (downloading to a temporary file, then letting the part
 * load from the temporary file).
 * To use the built-in network transparency, you only need to implement
 * openFile(), not openUrl().
 *
 * To implement network transparency differently (e.g. for progressive loading,
 * like a web browser does for instance), or to prevent network transparency
 * (but why would you do that?), you can override openUrl().
 *
 * An application using KParts can use the signals to show feedback while
 * the URL is being loaded.
 *
 * ReadOnlyPart handles the window caption by setting it to the current URL
 * (set in openUrl(), and each time the part is activated).
 * If you want another caption, set it in openFile() and,
 * if the part might ever be used with a part manager, in guiActivateEvent().
